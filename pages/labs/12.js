          <h3>
            In this lab, the definition of an electric field was used to analyze
            the net charges of oil droplets based on their initial mass and a
            known voltage. Charged particles were placed between an area with an
            electric field and let to move. The particle's mass was varied (the
            mass varied in an unknown way). The voltage needed and final
            velocity was measured. The charge, particle mass, charge to mass
            ratio, and charge in terms of value of e was measured. The results
            indicated that, for all particles, the charge in terms of e was an
            integer. This is significant as it indicates that charge is
            quantized.

          <h2>Procedure</h2>
          <h3>
            1. On the “Capacitance” tab of the PhET simulation, the plate
            separation and plate area was varied while everything else was kept
            constant. The resulting capacitance was changed. <p />
            2. Step 1 was then repeated, however this time the voltage and
            capacitance were varied and the stored energy was measured using the
            voltmeter.
            <p />
            3. A power regression was used to find the relationship between the
            data collected in steps 1 and 2.
            <p />
            4. On the “Light Bulb” tab, the plates were charged by increasing
            the battery voltage The battery was then disconnected.
            <p />
            5. The voltmeter was connected across the light bulbs, and the
            capacitor was also attached to the light bulb. The changes in
            potential difference were qualitatively observed.

          <h2>Discussion</h2>
          <h3>
            The relationship between mass and charge can be found by setting the
            gravitational force equal to the electric field force, giving us an
            expression for the charge in terms of mass 𝑚, 𝑔, and the electric
            field 𝐸. <p />
            𝑚𝑔 = 𝐸𝑞 → 𝑞 = 𝑚𝑔/𝐸 <p />
            By substituting 𝐸 as an expression of voltage and distance, we get{" "}
            <p />
            𝐸=𝑉/𝑟 <p />
            𝑞 = 𝑟𝑚𝑔/𝑉 <p />
            Where 𝑟 = 0.05 𝑚. So, charge increases as mass increases. The values
            we obtained were not expected because from our expression for mass,
            it should be proportional to the square of the velocity, which is
            not always the case in our data. From observing the charge to mass
            ratio in terms of 𝑒, no clear trend is found as the value sometimes
            increases then decreases while velocity continues to decrease in
            magnitude, though this could be due to errors in measuring the
            voltage.
            <p />
            Sources of error are not super prevalent in this lab due to the
            nature of it being a simulation. Potential sources of error could
            come from measuring the data, specifically the voltage that results
            in the particle being at rest, which proved to be difficult since it
            was hard for the naked eye to tell if a particle was still or moving
            very slowly. Measurement error could be minimized by conducting more
            trials.
