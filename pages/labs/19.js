          <h3>
            In this lab, the effect of a changing magnetic field over time was
            explored. A magnet was moved around a conducting coil to change the
            magnetic field (changing variable). The resultant current was
            measured based on how brightly it made a lightbulb shine. The
            results were that a current was induced when the magnetic field
            change, which is important as it confirms Faradayâ€™s laws.
