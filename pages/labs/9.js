          <h3>
            In this lab, the effects of torque on a rolling object were explored
            through comparing the rotational and total kinetic energy of an
            object. In a lab simulation, a ball was rolled down an incline. Its
            mass and the incline angle were varied; its initial gravitational
            potential energy, final translational kinetic energy, and final
            rotational kinetic energy were measured; the ratios of the different
            energies were calculated. It was found that in all scenarios, the
            ratios between rotational and translational kinetic energies were
            about equal to â…–, the same as the coefficient for the formula of
            moment of inertia of a sphere. This lab demonstrates how moment of
            inertia plays a role in determining how much kinetic energy ends up
            translational and how much ends up rotational.
